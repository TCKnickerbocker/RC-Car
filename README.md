# RC-Car

RC Car Software for Applied AI Club

## Input data:

- Images (from RC camera) -> where yellow lines are/will be
- Current MPH
- Current steering angle

## Output Data:

- Decide Brake/None/Accelerate
- Angle to move wheels

## Goal:

- Have RC utilize AI to detect & drive between white/yellow lines

## Helpful Resources:

1. GPIO, a module to use the raspberry pi's input/output pins

   - DOCS: https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Examples/
   - INSTALLATION GUIDE: https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/install/

2. Thonny (IDE for Raspberry Pi. UI seems janky. Could also setup VSCode to do this):
